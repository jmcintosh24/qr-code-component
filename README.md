### What I learned

In this challenge I learned the basic boilerplate setup and format of an HTML document. I also learned basic elements like <div> <img> <h1-h6> and <p>. Through researching online I discovered the difference between block and inline elements, though I am still a bit confused on how this corresponds to the visual layout. I find it confusing to know when an element is considered a block or inline.

I was able to use CSS to get the layout to match the design. I learned about the different unit values available for fields like px, %, em, vh, etc.
